						<h1>Papers</h1>
						<p>Some of the most influential courses for my personal and professional development have been for my second major: philosophy-neuroscience-psychology. This major is intended to foster engagement between different disciplines that investigate the mind and brain. In doing so, the program has also opened my eyes to an entirely different way of thinking about and approaching problems. A key differentiator I have seen between good web developers and great developers is how well one understands his or her users. Skill and technique can only take a project so far without a holistic understanding of the users, and this requires a rich understanding of how people think.</p>
						<p>Below are several papers I have written that have helped develop my understanding of the world and have shaped my perpsective. Please feel free to contact me with any thoughts or questions you may have at jsangiamo@wustl.edu.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-12">
								<p>This paper is a response to Anthony Scarantino's Motivational Theory of Emotions which elucidates the connection between human emotions and behavior. My specific critique of Scarantino's argument is that he fails to address why it is that this connection between emotion and action must be a fundamental characteristic of the emotion itself. I then propose a refined account of emotions that incorporates the strengths of Scarantino's argument without making this presumption.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-12">
									<p>We frequently use our emotions to guide our actions, but can emotions really serve a primary epistemic justifier? This is to ask if emotions can convey information that we would otherwise be unable to glean from our experiences. In this paper I respond to philosopher Adam Pesler who has argued that there are instances in which emotions do convey information that would otherwise be inaccessable. After analyzing Pesler's argument, I recount a common objection to this argument and explain why I believe it withstands the criticsm.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-12">
							<p>Anxiety is often thought of as a paralyzing, detrimental emotion. This piece is in response to a paper by philosopher (and former teacher of mine) Charlie Kurth that explored the idea that anxiety can actually prove useful in regulation of social behavior and that the importance of this role that anxiety plays has increased as human civilizations have become increasingly complex. I argue that the downfall of the argument made by this paper is that it loses sight of what really defines the identity of an emotion: its phenomenology.</p>
